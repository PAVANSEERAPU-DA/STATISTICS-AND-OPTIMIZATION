# 📊 Statistics and Optimization

## 📁 Repository Overview

This repository encompasses a project focused on statistical analysis and optimization techniques, particularly emphasizing logistic regression for predicting hospital readmissions. It includes datasets, a Jupyter Notebook, and a detailed PDF report documenting the methodology and findings.

## 📝 Contents

* `hospitaldata.csv`: Dataset containing patient information and readmission status.
* `CA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing logistic regression analysis.
* `LOGISTIC REGRESSION ON HOSPITAL READMISSION PREDICTION.pdf`: Comprehensive report detailing the project's objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary goal is to utilize logistic regression to predict the likelihood of patient readmission based on various health and demographic factors. This analysis aids in identifying key predictors and optimizing healthcare strategies to reduce readmission rates.

## 🔍 Methodology

* **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
* **Model Implementation**: Applying logistic regression to the preprocessed dataset.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## 📈 Results and Findings

The logistic regression model demonstrated \[insert key findings here, e.g., "an accuracy of 85% in predicting patient readmissions, with significant predictors including age and prior hospitalization history."] *(Note: Replace with actual findings from your analysis.)*
